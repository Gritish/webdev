    <div class="box3"><p>Choosing the correct material for your project is vital to it's success. 3D printing offers a wide range of options when it comes to materials.
        Usually with only small changes to the calibration of the printer, there is a filament for every project.</p>

            Polylactic Acid, commonly known as PLA, is one of the most popular materials used in desktop 3D printing. 
            It is the default filament of choice for most extrusion-based 3D printers because it can be printed at a low temperature and does not require a heated bed. 
            PLA is a great first material to use as you are learning about 3D printing because it is easy to print, very inexpensive, and creates parts that can be used for a wide variety of applications. It is also one of the most environmentally friendly filaments on the market today. 
            Derived from crops such as corn and sugarcane, PLA is renewable and most importantly biodegradable.

                <li>Low Cost</li>
                <li>Stiff and good strength</li>
                <li>Good dimensional accuracy</li>
                <li>Good shelf life</li>

            Thermoplastic Polyurethane or TPU is referred to as the bridge between rubbers and plastics. 
            The material appears rubber-like, which means it can be extremely flexible, durable and smooth to the touch. 
            All these properties and compound versatility makes TPU widely used in many industries for coatings, components and customer goods. 
            It is often used for 3D printing.

            3D filament filled with metal. The base material is high performance PLA compounded with durable metal such as bronze or copper. 
            The resulting filament imparts the look and feel of a metal object. The unique filament uses a regular PLA printing profile, so it is very easy to print and environmentally friendly.
